We were founded on the principal of providing unwavering, ethical, unbiased advice to our clients.

The market has moved considerably since our inception. The mainframe dominated, then the midrange, now the endpoint du jour. The idea of timesharing in the late 80's/early 90's is now fully operational in places like AWS/Azure and the like.Regardless of the technology, the principles which guide technology have not changed only the delivery medium.

As part of our core mission, we are always interested in what is "right" for the customer. This is always seems ambiguous at first but with careful discovery, thoughtful conversations, and properly defining the objective it becomes crystal clear. Our ask of our customers is to be honest with us in all your communications so we do not waste each others time or efforts. Time is a precious commodity and we value yours and hope you value ours.
